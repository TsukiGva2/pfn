## why making yet another language?

i know, most of the stuff i do is mess around with
programming languages, but this is the last one, i
promise.

## code sample?

here you go.

```
.f (          // defining a function f
	|x,y|       // with arguments x and y

	-> add(x,y) /* return the result of add(x,y)
								 ("->" is for return) */
)

a:=2          // defining a variable a with value 2

>f(a,5)       /* the ">" is for printing a value
							   which is the result of the function
								 f with arguments a and 5 */
```
