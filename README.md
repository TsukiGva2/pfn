# pfn

## why making yet another language?

i know, most of the stuff i do is mess around with
programming languages, but this is the last one, i
promise.

## code sample?

here you go.

```
.f ( // defining a function f
	|x,y| // with arguments x and y

	-> + x,y /* return x + y, (yes, i know, +x,y is pretty cumbersome)
	"->" is for return */
)

a:=2          // defining a variable a with value 2

>f(a,5)       /* the ">" is for printing a value
        	which is the result of the function
        	f with arguments a and 5 */
```
